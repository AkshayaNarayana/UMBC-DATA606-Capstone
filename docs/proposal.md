# 2. Background
### What is it about?

The dataset includes job posting details such as job ID, experience requirements, qualifications, salary range, location, company information, and more. It provides a complete overview of career prospects in a variety of industries, locations, and firms. It is a valuable resource for conducting employment market dynamics research and may be used for activities such as trend identification, geographic evaluation, and natural language processing (NLP) investigation of job descriptions.

### Why does it matter?

Anyone involved in the hiring process, from recruiters to lawmakers, has a vested interest in comprehending the data about job postings. People looking for jobs can learn more about the skills and abilities that employers want, and recruiters can look at patterns in how they hire people. Policymakers can use this kind of data to learn about the job market and make smart choices.

### What are your research questions?

1. How has the volume of job postings changed over the years?
2. Is there any seasonality or periodicity in job postings throughout the year?
3. What are the top skills consistently in demand across different roles and industries?
4. How do skill requirements vary among different job roles and industries?
